# CORTX-HA

CORTX-HA or High-Availability, ensures the availability of CORTX at all times and prevents hardware component or software service failures. If any of your hardware components or software services are affected, CORTX-HA takes over the failover or failback control flow and stabilizes them across the CORTX cluster.
